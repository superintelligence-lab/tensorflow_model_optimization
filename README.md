# tensorflow_model_optimization

This repository contains two files: quantization_aware_training.ipynb and 

quantization_aware_training.ipynb provides you with a tutorial to explore Quantization Aware Training in TensorFlow.

In this tutorial you will:
1. Train a tf.keras model for MNIST from scratch.
2. Fine tune the model by applying the quantization aware training API, see the accuracy, and export a quantization aware model.
3. Use the model to create an actually quantized model for the TFLite backend.
4. See the persistence of accuracy in TFLite and a 4x smaller model.
